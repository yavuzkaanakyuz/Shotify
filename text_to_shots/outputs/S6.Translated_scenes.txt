SCENE 1 / VILLAGE ROAD / DAY / EXTERIOR / HODJA

Hodja trudges slowly under the scorching sun, sweat soaking his clothes. He looks around, seeking shade.

HODJA  
(grumbling)  
Too hot... need shade and a change.

He spots a cemetery ahead and heads toward it, scratching his head.

HODJA  
Nowhere else to go. Even the dead stay cooler.

SCENE 2 / CEMETERY / DAY / EXTERIOR / HODJA

Hodja enters cautiously, weaving between gravestones until he finds one tall enough for privacy. He slips behind it, takes off his robe, and begins removing his soaked inner clothes, muttering.

HODJA  
Nothing wrong with this... Nice breeze, good height... starting to envy the dead.

Suddenly, hoofbeats approach. Three horsemen pass by, see Hodja half-naked among the graves, and pull up, surprised.

SCENE 3 / EDGE OF CEMETERY / DAY / EXTERIOR / HODJA AND HORSEMEN

Horsemen dismount, visibly upset. Hodja hurriedly dresses, then stands tall, smiling.

HORSEMAN 1  
What are you doing here like this, old man? This is a cemetery!

HORSEMAN 2  
Is this proper for someone your age?

Hodja finishes dressing, adjusts his turban, and responds calmly.

HODJA  
This is my grave. I got tired of lying down—thought I’d take a walk.

The horsemen stare in silence; one laughs, others shake their heads and ride off chuckling.

SCENE 4 / VILLAGE ROAD / DAY / EXTERIOR / HODJA

Hodja exits the cemetery, still damp but smiling slyly.

HODJA  
(to himself)  
Well, I cooled off... and gave the graveyard a little humor.

He strolls along the road as the scene fades out.

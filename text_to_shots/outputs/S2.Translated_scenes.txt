SCENE 1 / BARBERSHOP / DAY / INTERIOR / HODJA – APPRENTICE  
Hodja arrives outside, peering through the window, noticing the master barber is absent. He frowns and mutters about needing a shave. The apprentice sees him and calls out cheerfully.  

APPRENTICE  
Ooo, Hodja! Come in! Just a beard trim today, or shall I do your hair too?  

Hodja enters, greeting the apprentice and asking about the master.  

HODJA  
Peace be upon you, apprentice efendi. Isn’t your master here?  

APPRENTICE  
He went to the market. He won’t be back until evening.  

HODJA  
Alright then, go ahead and give me a beard trim.  

Hodja removes his turban and robe, settling into the chair as the apprentice prepares for shaving.  

SCENE 2 / BARBERSHOP / DAY / INTERIOR / HODJA – APPRENTICE  
The apprentice sharpens the razor, then begins shaving Hodja. Hodja flinches as the razor touches his cheek.  

HODJA  
Ah! What are you doing, boy?!  

APPRENTICE  
Don’t worry, Hodja. It’s just a small cut. Let me put some cotton on it so it doesn’t bleed.  

The apprentice applies cotton to each cut, repeatedly nicking Hodja’s face. One side becomes covered in cotton.  

Frustrated, Hodja jumps up, pulls off the towel, and puts on his turban. He retrieves his robe and heads for the door.  

The apprentice tries to stop him.  

APPRENTICE  
Hodja, where are you going? Your shave isn’t finished!  

Hodja turns back, addressing the apprentice.  

HODJA  
My son, can’t you see? You’ve already planted cotton on one side of my face. If you’ll allow me, I’ll go and plant flax on the other.  

Hodja leaves, leaving the apprentice speechless and embarrassed.  

HODJA (turning once more)  
Give my regards to your master—and tell him not to leave the shop unattended in broad daylight!  

Hodja steps outside and walks away down the street.

SCENE 1 / STREET OUTSIDE NEIGHBOR’S HOUSE / EVENING / EXTERIOR / HODJA – NEIGHBOR

Hodja walks toward the house, observing the neighbor quickly pulling his head back inside upon seeing him.  

HODJA (voice-over)  
"That man invited me only because others are watching. An invitation is an invitation."  

The neighbor, noticing Hodja, quickly ducks inside.  

HODJA  
Hah! He was peeking and vanished. I’ll knock."  

Hodja approaches and knocks loudly. No response. He waits, then calls out.  

HODJA  
"Neighbor, neighbor! I see your light—come open the door!"  

A disguised male voice responds from behind the door.  

NEIGHBOR (DISGUISED)  
"Oh, Hodja! The master was just here, but he left a moment ago. I’ll tell him you came—he’ll be sorry to have missed you."  

Hodja’s expression hardens. He replies sharply.  

HODJA  
"Tell the master, next time he leaves, not to forget his head in the window!"  

Hodja turns and walks away, clasping his hands behind his back, clearly frustrated.

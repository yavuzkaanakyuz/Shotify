SCENE 1 / HODJA'S GARDEN, PERGOLA / DAY / EXTERIOR / HODJA, NEIGHBOR, HODJA’S WIFE

The neighbor knocks on the garden gate. Hodja gets up, muttering, and opens it.

HODJA  
"Welcome, my neighbor. Please come in."

HODJA’S WIFE  
"Come on! I brought you ice-cold ayran."

HODJA  
(Turning to neighbor)  
"Come in! My wife made ayran. You can cool off inside."

NEIGHBOR  
"Thank you, Judge Efendi. That would be lovely."

They sit on a garden bench.

NEIGHBOR  
"I have a complaint against Mehmet Efendi."

HODJA  
"Oh, really?"

NEIGHBOR  
"Yes! I came here so you would listen."

HODJA  
"I see. What is it? Tell me."

NEIGHBOR  
"Mehmet Efendi places his water jugs by my garden wall. I might trip over them. I warned him many times, but he still does it!"

HODJA  
"You are right, Mehmet Efendi. You are absolutely right."

NEIGHBOR  
"See! He’s going to make me fall! Thank you, Hodja. The ayran was refreshing. I’ll be on my way."

He gets up and leaves.

SCENE 2 / HODJA'S GARDEN, PERGOLA / DAY / EXTERIOR / HODJA, MEHMET EFENDI, HODJA’S WIFE

Mehmet Efendi knocks on the gate. Hodja rises and opens it.

MEHMET EFENDI  
"Hodja! I have something to tell you!"

HODJA  
"Go ahead."

MEHMET EFENDI  
"Let me sit down."

Mehmet Efendi steps inside.

HODJA  
"Wife, make us two cups of tea."

HODJA (to Mehmet)  
"How is everything going?"

MEHMET EFENDI  
"Work is fine, but I’m fed up with Saffet Agha! I came because I have a complaint."

HODJA’S WIFE arrives with a tray of three glasses of tea and sugar. She offers the tray, then takes her tea.

HODJA  
"So, you came to file a complaint?"

MEHMET EFENDI  
"Yes! He nags me daily—about my water jugs, building walls, quieting chickens. I have no patience left."

HODJA  
"You are right, Mehmet Efendi. You are absolutely right."

MEHMET EFENDI  
"Thank you! Your tea was excellent. I’ll take my leave. Stay well!"

He leaves, closing the gate.

SCENE 3 / HODJA'S HOUSE / DAY / INTERIOR / HODJA, HODJA’S WIFE

HODJA’S WIFE  
"Husband, what have you done?"

HODJA  
"What do you mean?"

HODJA’S WIFE  
"Saffet Efendi complained about Mehmet Efendi. You told him he was right."

HODJA  
"Yes."

HODJA’S WIFE  
"Then Mehmet Efendi badmouthed Saffet. And you told him he was right too!"

HODJA  
"Yes."

She looks at him sharply.

HODJA’S WIFE  
"But they’re accusing each other! How can both be right? You’re the judge! Decide who is wrong."

HODJA pauses, then smiles slightly.

HODJA  
"Wife, you are right too. You are absolutely right."

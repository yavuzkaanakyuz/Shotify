SCENE 1 / HODJA'S HOUSE / MORNING / INTERIOR / HODJA  
Hodja stirs a simmering stew in his modest kitchen, a basket of cleaned quails nearby. He looks satisfied.  

HODJA  
(murmuring)  
"Ohh... That’s perfect. Such flavor for a poor man like me."  

He covers the pot, washes his hands, and calls out:  
HODJA  
"Wife, I’ll invite the neighbors. Let’s share this blessing."  

He grabs his stick and leaves.  

SCENE 2 / VILLAGE STREET / MORNING / EXTERIOR / HODJA – NEIGHBOR WOMAN  
Hodja walks along a dirt path. A sly woman with a headscarf follows discreetly.  

HODJA  
"Neighbor, come join us for dinner. It’s good to share."  

The woman nods with a smile. She quickly enters Hodja’s house after he leaves.  

SCENE 3 / HODJA’S KITCHEN / MORNING / INTERIOR / NEIGHBOR WOMAN  
The woman opens the door quietly, lifts the lid, and empties the stew into her container. She replaces the food with live quails she brought, covers the pot, and leaves silently.  

SCENE 4 / VILLAGE STREET / MIDDAY / EXTERIOR / HODJA  
Hodja visits neighbors, inviting them cheerfully.  

HODJA  
"I’ve cooked a feast! Come share the food and company tonight!"  

SCENE 5 / HODJA’S HOUSE / MIDDAY / INTERIOR / HODJA  
Hodja returns, excited. He opens the pot, expecting a meal, but finds only feathers. Suddenly, two live quails flap out and escape through the window.  

He stands frozen, then raises his hands in prayer and tilts his head upward.  

HODJA  
(sincerely, with a hint of frustration)  
"God... I don’t doubt Your power. You gave them life. You let them fly free. I accept that.  
But what about my oil... my pepper... my salt...  
...my fire, oh Lord?"  

He shakes his head and walks outside, leaving the empty pot behind.

SCENE 1 / HODJA'S HOUSE / NIGHT / INTERIOR / HODJA, Wife  
Cold winter night. Wind howling outside. Hodja and his wife sleep under a thick quilt. Suddenly, loud shouting and footsteps awaken them.  

WIFE  
(sleepy, concerned)  
“Efendi… Do you hear that noise outside?”  

HODJA  
(grumbling, getting up)  
“Of course I hear it, dear. It sounds like the town square’s turned into a caravan stop again.”  

Hodja wraps himself in the quilt and steps outside. His wife watches anxiously from the doorway.  

SCENE 2 / VILLAGE SQUARE / NIGHT / EXTERIOR / HODJA, YOUNG MEN  
Three young men argue loudly in the dimly lit square. Two are fighting, one pretends to intervene but enjoys the chaos. Hodja approaches.  

HODJA  
(firm, calm)  
“What’s all this noise in the middle of the night? Did one of you get married and forget to invite me?”  

The boys pause briefly, then resume bickering. Hodja’s quilt slips from his shoulders as he tries to counsel them.  

HODJA  
(trying to advise)  
“Fighting is easy, boys... But real warmth is found sitting around a stove, sharing wise words.”  

Suddenly, one boy notices the quilt. Another nods knowingly. Two boys sneak closer and grab the quilt, running off with it.  

The remaining boys scatter, laughing. Hodja stands stunned, quilt gone.  

SCENE 3 / HODJA'S HOUSE / NIGHT / INTERIOR / HODJA, Wife  
Hodja returns home shivering. His wife rushes to him, looking around for the quilt.  

WIFE  
(startled)  
“What happened, Efendi? Where’s the quilt?”  

Hodja moves slowly toward the fire, eyes downcast.  

HODJA  
(sighing, frustrated)  
“Don’t ask, my dear... Apparently, the quilt was the reason for the fight. The quilt is gone… and so is the fight.”

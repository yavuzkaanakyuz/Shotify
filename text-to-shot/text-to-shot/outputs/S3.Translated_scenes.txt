SCENE 1 / STREET OUTSIDE THE NEIGHBOR’S HOUSE / EVENING / EXTERIOR / HODJA – NEIGHBOR

Hodja walks slowly along a quiet village street, pauses, and looks at the neighbor’s house with a serious expression, speaking to himself.

HOJA  
(voice-over)  
“That man invited me out of social obligation. If no one had heard, he wouldn’t have done it. Still, once the invitation is made, I must respond.”

The neighbor notices Hodja approaching and quickly pulls his head back inside the window.

HOJA  
Hah! He was watching from the window and ducked inside the moment he saw me. Let me knock on the door.

Hodja approaches the door and knocks. No response. He waits, then knocks louder and calls out.

HOJA  
Neighbor! Neighbor! Your light’s on—I can see it! Come on now, open up!

A disguised voice responds from behind the door.

NEIGHBOR (DISGUISED)  
Oh dear Hodja! What a pity! The master of the house was just here, but he’s gone out. I’ll tell him you came—he’ll be so sorry to have missed you!

Hodja’s expression hardens; he furrows his brow and replies sharply.

HOJA  
Well then, tell the master of the house not to forget his head in the window next time he goes out!

Hodja turns and walks away quickly, his steps agitated.
